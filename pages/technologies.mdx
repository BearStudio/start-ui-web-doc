## TypeScript

JavaScript is a not typed language. [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
is here to help add static type definition. TypeScript helps a lot when it comes
to types, interfaces and define contract between functions which helps a lot for
a reliable documentation. No worry, the TypeScript adoption is incremental and
writing in TypeScript is not mandatory to use Start UI, but it is a good
practice to do so to avoid bugs in the future.
