## Getting Started

```bash
npx create-start-ui@latest --web myApp
```

That will scaffold a new folder with the latest version of 🚀 Start UI <small>[web]</small> 🎉

Then just go to the created folder:

```bash
cd myApp
```

```bash
# Duplicate the .env.example file to a new .env file (update variables)
cp .env.example .env

# Init the local mocks database and seed users
yarn db:push && yarn db:seed

# Run the development server
yarn dev
```

## Installation

1. Duplicate the `.env.example` file to a new `.env` file, and update the environment variables

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

2. Install dependencies
```bash
yarn install
```

3. Init the local mocks database and seed users
```bash
yarn db:push && yarn db:seed
```

## Development

```bash
# Run the development server
yarn dev
```

### Storybook

```bash
yarn storybook
```

### NodeJS (recommended)

```bash
yarn install
yarn storybook:build # Optional: Will expose the Storybook at `/storybook`
yarn build
yarn start
```

### Docker

1. Build the Docker image (replace `start-ui-web` with your project name)
```
docker build -t start-ui-web .
```

2. Run the Docker image (replace `start-ui-web` with your project name)
```
docker run -p 80:3000 start-ui-web
```
Application will be exposed on port 80 ([http://localhost](http://localhost))

### Static files

Update the `next.config.js` file with `output: 'export'` (and remove `redirects` and `rewrites`)

```js
{
  output: 'export',
}
```

```bash
yarn storybook:build # Optional: Will expose the Storybook at `/storybook/`
yarn build
```

Then expose the `/out` folder.

> You can use `yarn build && npx serve out -c ../static.serve.json` to build and run the static build locally.

> 💡 You will need to setup your server to rewrite all `/app/*` urls to serve the `app.html` file.

#### Using Apache as your web server

If you are using [apache](https://httpd.apache.org/) to statically deploy your app, you can use the following configuration for `public/.htaccess` :

```bash
# public/.htaccess
Options -MultiViews
RewriteEngine On

# Rewrite /app/* to app.html
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteRule "^app/" "app.html" [QSA,L]
```
