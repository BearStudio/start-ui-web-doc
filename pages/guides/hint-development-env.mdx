# Hint on development environments

## Why?

Allows to have a visual hint by environment to prevent funny debugging moments.

## How?

Setup the `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEV_ENV_NAME` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEV_ENV_COLOR_SCHEME` env variables with the name of the environment and the wanted hint color.

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_DEV_ENV_NAME=staging
NEXT_PUBLIC_DEV_ENV_COLOR_SCHEME=teal
```
