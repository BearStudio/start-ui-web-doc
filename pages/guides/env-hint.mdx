# Visual hint for environments

## Why?

Allows to have a visual hint by environment to prevent funny debugging moments.

## How?

Setup the `NEXT_PUBLIC_ENV_NAME`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_ENV_EMOJI` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_ENV_COLOR_SCHEME` env variables with the name of the environment and the wanted hint color.

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENV_NAME="staging"
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENV_EMOJI="ðŸ§ª"
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENV_COLOR_SCHEME="teal"
```
