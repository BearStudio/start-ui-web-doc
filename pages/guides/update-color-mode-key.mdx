# Update color mode storage key

## Why?

If you work on several projects, that allows avoid to share same color mode key, and in some case to run a project on a not manage color mode.

## How?

You can update the storage key used to detect the project color mode by updating this constant:

```tsx filename="src/theme/config.ts"
export const COLOR_MODE_STORAGE_KEY = "start-ui-color-mode"; // Update the key according to your needs
```
