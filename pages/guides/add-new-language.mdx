# Add a new language

## Why?

You may want to add a new language to your app to make your content available to a larger audience.

## How?

### Add the translation files

First, you will have to add the JSON translation files under the `src/locales/<yourLanguageCode>` folder,
with `yourLanguageCode` being a country's alpha2 code (`de` for instance), or a value allowed by
[React i18next](https://react.i18next.com/legacy-v9/step-by-step-guide#1-adding-more-languages).

### Import translations in the index

All translation files are referenced in the `src/locales/index.ts` file. You need to import the new folder
you created, for instance, for german :

```ts filename="src/locales/index.ts"
import de from "@/locales/de";
```

and add it to the default export :

```ts filename="src/locales/index.ts"
export default { en, fr, ar, sw, de } as const;
```

### Import the dayjs locale

StartUI is using dayjs to format dates, and each country has its own specificities for displaying dates, so you need to
import the new locale's plugin in the `src/locales/index.ts` file, for instance :

```ts filename="src/locales/index.ts"
import "dayjs/locale/de";
```

You can find the available plugins [here](https://github.com/iamkun/dayjs/tree/dev/src/locale)

### Add the language to the list of user's available languages

Finally, you need to add the language to the `AVAILABLE_LANGUAGES` list in `src/lib/i18n/constants.ts`, in order
to make the language appear in the Select when creating an account.
