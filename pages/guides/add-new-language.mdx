# Add a new language

## Why?

You may want to add a new language to your app to make your content available to a larger audience.

## How?

### Add the translation files

First, you will have to add the JSON translation files under the `src/locales/<yourLanguageCode>` folder,
with `yourLanguageCode` being a country's alpha2 code (`de` for example).

Initiate the dayjs locale and the zod locale in this file.

Example:

```ts filename="src/locales/de/index.ts"
import "dayjs/locale/de";
import zod from "zod-i18n-map/locales/de/zod.json";
```

### Import translations in the index

All translation files are referenced in the `src/locales/index.ts` file. You need to import the new folder
you created, for instance, for german:

```ts filename="src/locales/index.ts"
import de from "@/locales/de";
```

and add it to the default export:

```ts filename="src/locales/index.ts"
export default { en, fr, ar, sw, de } as const;
```

### Add the language to the list of user's available languages

Finally, you need to add the language to the `AVAILABLE_LANGUAGES` list in `src/lib/i18n/constants.ts`, in order
to make the language appear in the Select when creating an account.
